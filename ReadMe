1. Session Cookies
Session cookies, also known as transient cookies, are temporary cookies that are created and stored in the user's browser for the duration of a session.

Lifetime: They are deleted as soon as the user closes the browser.
Use Case: Commonly used for maintaining the state of the user's session. For example, they keep the user logged in while navigating through different pages of a website.
Storage: Stored in the browser's memory and not written to the hard drive.
Security: Considered more secure than persistent cookies as they do not persist after the session ends, reducing the risk of them being accessed by unauthorized parties.

2. Persistent Cookies
Persistent cookies, also known as permanent cookies or stored cookies, remain on the user's device for a set period or until they are manually deleted by the user. 

Lifetime: They have an expiration date set by the website, which can be days, months, or even years. They remain on the user's device until they expire or are deleted.
Use Case: Often used for remembering user preferences and settings, login details, and tracking user behavior over a long period. For example, they can remember the user's language preference or keep the user logged in between sessions.
Storage: Written to the user's hard drive and stored in a specific location depending on the browser.
Security: While useful, they can pose a privacy risk as they persist over time and can potentially be accessed by unauthorized parties if not handled securely.
